# Demos
A repo for demo notebooks/scripts of various tools and techniques I've explored recently. Most of them are about LLMs and LLM agent systems. The idea is to demonstrate the basics of a tool/library/whatever and also contain links to documentation and other resources.

## Contents
### misc folder

Miscellanous stuff I for some reason want to demonstrate.

- [Elias-Fano Indexes.pdf](https://github.com/PetteriMoilanen/Demos/blob/main/misc/Elias-Fano%20Indexes.pdf) - A information retrieval seminar report from my data science studies.
- 
### notebooks folder

Stand-alone Colab notebooks.

- [Introducing Groq](notebooks/Groq_demo.ipynb) - A short introduction to the Groq inference platform.
- [Introducing Smolagents (and Qwen)](notebooks/smolagents_demo.ipynb) - A demo/guide to Hugging Face smolagents (plus a bit about Qwen models). **Under construction!**
- [Creating a LLM agent with plain Python](notebooks/LLM_agent_with_plain_Python.ipynb) A notebook from Lesson 1: Simple ReAct Agent from Scratch from the course AI Agents in LangGraph by DeepLearning.AI. It's a nice framework-agnostic demonstration of the basics of a ReAct agent system. I've added some comments to the course notebook, which itself is based on https://til.simonwillison.net/llms/python-react-pattern.

### Links
