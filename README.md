# Demos
A repo for demo notebooks/scripts of various tools and techniques I've explored. The idea is to demonstrate the basics of a tool/library/whatever and also contain links to documentation and other resources.

Will probably contain separate folders for different tools and such, but for now all is in the root.

## Contents:

- [Introducing Groq](Groq_demo.ipynb) - A short stand-alone Colab notebook introducing the Groq inference platform.
- [Introducing Smolagents (and Qwen)](smolagents_demo.ipyng) - A demo/guide to Hugging Face smolagents (plus a bit about Qwen models).
