# Demos
A repo for demo notebooks/scripts of various tools and techniques I've explored. The idea is to demonstrate the basics of a tool/library/whatever and also contain links to documentation and other resources.

## The directory structure
- **notebooks** folder contains stand-alone Jupyter notebooks demonstrating stuff.
- **projects** has whole projects with their own dependencies as subfolders.

## Contents

- **notebooks**
    - [Introducing Groq](Groq_demo.ipynb) - A short stand-alone Colab notebook introducing the Groq inference platform.
    - [Introducing Smolagents (and Qwen)](smolagents_demo.ipynb) - A demo/guide to Hugging Face smolagents (plus a bit about Qwen models). **Under construction!**
- **projects**

## Links

There may also be separate repos and demo apps hosted on HF Spaces and other such platforms. Links to them will be in this section.
